**Tableau Mini Capstone Project**  
**Author:** Udofia, Usungobong Daniel  
**Date:** October 2025  


## Project Overview
This project analyzes hospital pharmacy sales data to evaluate the financial impact of the **National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS)** on hospital revenue, profitability, and sustainability. Using **Tableau**, the analysis highlights sales patterns, profit drivers, and loss areas to support data-driven decision-making for hospital management.


## Objectives
- Identify medicines that contribute most to revenue and profit  
- Compare profitability between **NHIS** and **Non-NHIS** sales  
- Analyze monthly sales and profitability trends  
- Assess how financial outcomes may affect patient care quality  


## Key Research Questions
1. Which drugs generate the highest revenue and which drive losses?  
2. How does profitability differ between NHIS reimbursements and normal sales?  
3. How do trends in dispensed medicines affect revenue and profit over time?  
4. What are the potential impacts on patient care quality?  


## Methodology
- **Tool Used:** Tableau Desktop  
- **Data Preparation:**  
  - Field renaming for consistency  
  - Data type validation  

### Calculated Fields
- NHIS Profit  
- Non-NHIS Profit  
- Total Revenue  
- Total Profit  
- Profit Margin (%)  
- Profit/Loss Indicator  

### Key Visualizations
- Monthly sales and profit trends (line chart)  
- Top profit-contributing drugs (Pareto chart)  
- Top revenue-generating drugs with profit/loss indicator  
- NHIS vs Non-NHIS profit comparison  
- Drugs with highest losses  
- KPI dashboard  


## Major Findings
### Revenue & Profit Drivers
- **Top Revenue Drugs:** Anti-hypertensives, antibiotics, antidiabetics, antimalarials, and analgesics  
- High revenue does **not always translate to profit**, particularly under NHIS pricing  

### NHIS vs Non-NHIS Performance
- **Non-NHIS Profit:** ₦48.25M  
- **NHIS Loss:** ₦14.36M  
- **Total Net Profit:** ₦33.89M  

### Sales Trends
- Profit closely follows sales volume  
- Peak months align with higher patient inflow and non-NHIS purchases  
- NHIS reimbursement delays negatively impact cash flow  

### Patient Care Impact
**Positive**
- Improved access to essential medicines  
- Better medication adherence  

**Negative**
- Reduced stock of costly NHIS drugs  
- Substitution with cheaper alternatives  
- Delays or restrictions in dispensing  


## Key Insights Summary
- **Highest Profit Source:** Non-NHIS sales (₦48.25M)  
- **NHIS Impact:** ₦14.36M loss  
- **Average Profit Margin:** 14.08%  
- **Major Loss Drivers:** High-cost injectables  


## Recommendations
1. Introduce patient co-payment for NHIS drug cost differences  
2. Implement cross-subsidization using Non-NHIS profits  
3. Engage NHIS for periodic reimbursement reviews  


## Conclusion
NHIS improves access to medicines but poses financial challenges due to inadequate reimbursement. **Non-NHIS sales remain the primary profit driver**, sustaining pharmacy operations.

A data-driven pricing and reimbursement strategy is essential to balance patient affordability with hospital sustainability and ensure long-term quality care.
